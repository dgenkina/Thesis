Thesis outline:


Introduction
	Usual BS about how cold atoms are well controlled and tunable and we can use them
	to one day solve many body problems that are currently not solvable and engineer 
	quantum systems that don't even exist elsewhere just for shits and giggles. 

Chapter 1: BECs and DFGs intro 
	Bose-Einstein Condesnation
		Bose-Einstein distribution leading to phase transition
		-- Figure: pictures of bimodal distribution from theory & expt
		Brief overview of how we make BECs
		Average number, density, size
		-- Figure: images of in situ (partial transfer) BECs
	Degenerate Fermi gas
		Fermi-Dirac distribution leading to deviation from Maxwell-Boltzman (no phase transition)
		Brief overview of how we made DFGs
		Average number, density, size - contrast with BEC
		Brief status report on 2-D MOT plans	
	Brief description of RbK apparatus

	Imaging simulation for s-wave scattering experiment


Chapter 3: S-wave scattering experiment
	- Intro with explanation of how we used to have K and refer to Lauren's thesis

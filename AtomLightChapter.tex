\chapter{Atom--Light Interactions}
In this chapter, we review the physics of interactions between atoms and light in so far as they are relevant to our experiments. We describe the level structure of alkali atoms in section \ref{sec:atomicStructure}, including the fine and hyperfine interactions and the effects of external magnetic fields. We review the interaction of atoms with near-resonant light (section \ref{sec:NRatomLight}), pertinent to cooling and absorption imaging as well as Raman and rf coupling. We then detail interactions of atoms with far-detuned light (section \ref{sec:FoRatomLight}), pertinent to optical trapping and lattices. 

In the following sections, we use these basic interactions to explain the tools used in our experiments. We describe absorption imaging (section \ref{sec:absorptionImaging}), our detection scheme. We explain the basic physics of atoms in a 1D optical lattice potential (section \ref{sec:1Dlattice}), and the physics of Raman and rf coupling of hyperfine atomic levels (section \ref{sec:RamanRf}). 


\section{Level structure of alkali atoms}\label{sec:atomicStructure}

Alkali atoms (those in the first column of the periodic table) are the most commonly used for laser cooling. Their level structure can be understood as primarily the energy state of the single electron in the outer shell, interacting with the rest of the atom---the nucleus and all the other electrons---as a whole. The quantum numbers that describe the energy levels of the atom are the principal quantum number $N$, that electron's spin $S$, the orbital angular momentum $L$, and finally the nuclear spin $I$. The work described in this thesis was done with alkali species \Rb{} and \K{}.

\subsection{Fine and hyperfine sturcutre}\label{sec:hyperfine}

The fine structure of alkali atom comes from two corrections to the bare Hamiltonian. The bare Hamiltonian $H_0$ encompasses the kinetic enegy and the Coulomb interaction between the outermost electron and the rest of the atom. The first of these corrections is due to special relativity---it's the correction to the classical kinetic term. The energy shift due to this term, to leading order in the small parameter of velocity over the speed of light $v/c$, is given by\cite{Griffiths}
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{\rm rel} = -\frac{E_N^2}{2mc^2}\left(\frac{4N}{L-1/2}-3\right),
\end{equation}
where $E_N$ is the unperturbed energy and $m$ is the mass of the electron. 

The second correction comes from the spin--orbit interaction. In the frame of the outermost electron, the nucleus is orbiting it, creating a magnetic field. The magnetic dipole moment of the electron---given by $\vec{\mu_S}=-g_S\mu_{\rm B}\hat{\vec{S}}/\hbar$, where $g_S$ is the spin g-factor, $\mu_{\rm B}$ is the Bohr magneton, and $\vec{S}$ is the spin angular momentum operator---interacts with this magnetic field. The Hamiltonian describing this interaction is given by\cite{Thomas1926,Griffiths} 
\begin{equation}
H_{\rm SO}=\frac{Ze^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{g_s}{4me^2c^2}\frac{\hat{\vec{L}}\cdot\hat{\vec{S}}}{r^3}, 
\end{equation}
where $Z$ is a factor expressing the effective charge seen by the electron, $e$ is the electron charge, $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity and $r$ is the radial coordinate. This Hamiltonian does not commute with either $\hat{\vec{S}}$ or $\hat{\vec{L}}$, and therefore the projection quantum numbers $m_S$ and $m_L$ are no longer good quantum numbers. However, the total angular momentum $\hat{\vec{J}} = \hat{\vec{L}}+\hat{\vec{S}}$ does commute with the Hamiltonian, and therefore $m_J$ is still a good quantum number. We can rewrite the coupling term in the spin--orbit Hamiltonian as $\hat{\vec{L}}\cdot\hat{\vec{S}}=\hat{\vec{J}}^2-\hat{\vec{L}}^2-\hat{\vec{S}}^2$. The leading order shift in perturbation theory due to this interaction is given by 
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{\rm SO} = \frac{E^2_N}{mc^2} \left(\frac{N[J(J+1)-L(L+1)-S(S+1)]}{L(L+1/2)(L+1)}\right).
\end{equation}

Note that the relativistic and spin--orbit correction terms are of the same order. We therefore combine them into a total energy shift, called the fine structure shift. Using the fact that $S=1/2$ and $J=L\pm1/2$, this term can be written as
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{\rm fs} = \frac{E^2_N}{mc^2}\left(3 - \frac{4N}{J+1/2}\right),
\end{equation}
which splits the atomic energies according to the quantum number $J$. 

The ground state of \Rb{}, in term notation $N^{2S+1}L_J$ is $5^2s_{1/2}$, where $s$ is orbital notation indicating $L=0$. Since $L=0$, the ground state only has one possible value of $J=1/2$, and there is no ground state fine structure splitting. The first excited state $5^2p_J$ has orbital angular momentum $L=1$ (as indicated by $p$ in orbital notation). Therefore, $J$ can take on two different values: $1/2$ and $3/2$, producing a hyperfine splitting between the $5^2p_{1/2}$ and $5^2p_{3/2}$. The spectral feature associated with the ground $5^2s_{1/2}$ and lower excited $5^2p_{1/2}$ energy difference is conventionally called the $D1$ line, and the feature corresponding to the splitting between $5^2s_{1/2}$ and  $5^2p_{3/2}$ is the $D2$ line. For other alkalies, including \K{}, the ground state values of $L$ and $S$ are identical and only the $N$ value is different. Therefore, even though their energies vary, $D1$ and $D2$ lines feature in all alkalies.

\label{fig:RbKatomicStruct}
\end{figure}

There is a yet smaller correction to the bare Hamiltonian, causing what's known as the hyperfine splitting. This arises from the interaction of the nuclear spin magnetic dipole moment with the magnetic field created by the electron. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is
\begin{equation}
H_{\rm hfs} = -\hat{\vec{\mu}}_{I}\cdot\vec{B},
\label{eqn:hfsHam}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\vec{\mu}}_{I} = g_I\mu_B\hat{\vec{I}}$ is the nuclear spin magnetic dipole moment, $\hat{\vec{I}}$ is the nuclear spin operator and $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field seen by the nucleus. The nuclear spin g-factor $g_I$ encompasses the entire complex structure of the nucleons, but is generally smaller than the electron spin g-factor $g_S$ by a factor of $m_e/m_p$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass and $m_p$ is the proton mass, making this term very small.  This magnetic field, to leading order, is given by \cite{Arimondo1977, Steck}
\begin{equation}
\vec{B} = 2\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\mu_{\rm B}\left(\frac{\hat{\vec{L}}}{\hat{r}^3} -\frac{1}{\hat{r}^3}\left[\hat{\vec{S}}-3\frac{\hat{\vec{S}}\cdot \hat{\vec{r}}}{\hat{r}^2}\hat{\vec{r}}\right]+\frac{2}{3}\delta(\vec{r}){\hat{r}^2}\hat{\vec{S}}\right),
\end{equation}
where the first term arises from the field due to the orbital angular momentum of the electron, the second term is the field created by the electron spin magnetic dipole moment, and the final term is the contact interaction, which is only non-zero for $L=0$ states. The hyperfine Hamiltonian eqn. \ref{eqn:hfsHam} contains both $\hat{\vec{I}}\cdot\hat{\vec{L}}$ and $\hat{\vec{I}}\cdot\hat{\vec{S}}$ terms. Therefore, $\hat{\vec{L}}$, $\hat{\vec{S}}$ and $\hat{\vec{I}}$ as well as $\hat{\vec{J}}$ no longer commute with the Hamiltonian and projection quantum numbers $m_L$, $m_S$, $m_J$ and $m_I$ are no longer good quantum numbers. However, the total spin including nuclear spin $\hat{\vec{F}} = \hat{\vec{L}}+\hat{\vec{S}}+\hat{\vec{I}}$ commutes with the Hamiltonian, and total spin $F$ and its projection $m_F$ are now good quantum numbers.

The energy shift, to lowest order in perturbation theory, due to the hyperfine interaction is given by \cite{Arimondo1977, Steck}
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{\rm hfs} = \frac{1}{2}A_{\rm hfs} K + B_{\rm hfs} \frac{\frac{3}{2}K(K+1)-2I(I+1)J(J+1)}{2I(2I-1)2J(2J-1)},
\end{equation}
where $K=F(F+1) - I(I+1)-J(J+1)$, $A_{\rm hfs}$ is the magnetic dipole constant of the electron, whose values for \Rb{} and \K{} can be found in \cite{Steck,Tiecke}. 

For \Rb{}, $I=3/2$ and for \K{}, $I=4$. The interaction with the nuclear spin splits the ground state of \Rb{} into two manifolds, $F=1$ and $F=2$. Similarly for \K{}, it splits the ground state into $F=9/2$ and $F=7/2$ manifolds. The structure of the ground and first excited states of \Rb{} and \K{}, including both the fine and hyperfine splittings, is diagrammed in Figure \ref{fig:RbKatomicStruct}. Note that the $D1$ and $D2$ transitions are in the optical regime, making them amenable to laser cooling. The fine structure splitting of the excited states is in the far infrared, whereas the hyperfine splitting of the ground states is in the microwave regime.  

\subsection{Interaction with static magnetic fields}\label{sec:hyperfineField}
In a static background magnetic field $\vec{B}$, the atomic angular momentum interacts with the field via the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H_B = \frac{\mu_{\rm B}}{\hbar}(g_S\hat{\vec{S}}+g_L\hat{\vec{L}}+g_I\hat{\vec{I}})\cdot\vec{B},
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\rm B}$ is the Bohr magneton, $g_S$, $g_L$ and $g_I$ are the spin, orbital and nuclear Land\'e g-factors correcting their respective magnetic dipole moments. Without loss of generality, we can define the magnetic field to be in the \ez{} direction, $\vec{B}=B_z$\ez{}, to obtain
\begin{equation}
H_B = \frac{\mu_{\rm B}}{\hbar}(g_S \hat{S}_z+g_L \hat{L}_z+g_I \hat{I}_z) B_z.
\label{eqn:BHam}
\end{equation}
%Interaction with magnetic fields gives rize to Zeeman (fine structure) and anomalous Zeeman (hyperfine structure). In between there are Paschen-bach and breit-rabi regimes

At very low magnetic field strengths, where the energy shift due to $H_B$ is small compared to the hyperfine splitting, the total angular momentum $F$ remains a good quantum number, and the Hamiltonian in eqn. \ref{eqn:BHam} can be re-written as
\begin{equation}
H_B = \frac{\mu_{\rm B}}{\hbar}(g_F \hat{F}_z) B_z,
\label{eqn:BHam}
\end{equation}
where the effective Lande g-factor is dependent on the angular momentum quantum numbers:
\begin{equation}
g_F = g_J\frac{F(F+1)-I(I+1)+J(J+1)}{2F(F+1)} + g_I\frac{F(F+1)+I(I+1)-J(J+1)}{2F(F+1)}.
\end{equation}
In this regime, the levels split linearly according to the $\hat{F}_z$ projection quantum number, $m_F$. For the ground state of \Rb{}, it splits into three hyperfine states in the $F=1$ manifold ($m_F=0,\pm1$) and five hyperfine states in the $F=2$ manifold ($m_F=0,\pm1,\pm2$). This regime is at fields $B\leq\approx1$ Gauss for \Rb{}, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:hyperfineSteck}. 

At fields producing energy shifts small compared to the fine structure splitting, but large compared to the hyperfine splitting, $F$ is no longer a good quantum number, and the relevant Hamiltonian becomes
\begin{equation}
H_B = \frac{\mu_{\rm B}}{\hbar}(g_J \hat{J}_z+g_I \hat{I}_z) B_z.
\end{equation}
Here, since $g_I \ll g_J$, the energy dependence on $B_z$ is dominated by a linear dependence on the $\hat{J}_z$ projection quantum number, $m_J$, as seen in the higher field limit in Figure \ref{fig:hyperfineSteck}. 

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{"Chapter2 Figures/BreitRabi".pdf}
\caption[Energy structure of hyperfine states of \Rb{} and \K{}]{Energy structure of hyperfine states of the ground state of (a) \Rb{} and (b)\K{} as a function of external magnetic field strength in Gauss. Note that the zero field splitting $\Delta E_{\rm hfs}$ by which the vertical axis is scaled is different for the two atomic species.}
\label{fig:hyperfineSteck}
\end{figure}

In the intermediate regime, there is in general no analytic solution for the eigenenergies and one must resort to numerics. However, for the specific case of $J=1/2$ applicable to alkali ground states, there is an analytic solution given by the Breit-Rabi formula \cite{BreitRabi}:
\begin{equation}
E_{\ket{J=1/2 m_J I m_I}} = - \frac{\Delta E_{\rm hfs}}{2(2I+1)}+g_I \mu_{\rm B} m B \pm \frac{\Delta E_{\rm hfs}}{2}\left(1+\frac{4mx}{2I+1}+x^2\right)^{1/2},
\label{eqn:BreitRabi}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta E_{\rm hfs}$ is the zero field hyperfine splitting, $m=m_I\pm m_J$, and
\begin{equation}
x=\frac{(g_J - g_I)\mu_{\rm B} B}{\Delta E_{\rm hfs}}.
\end{equation}
From this we can get a better picture of the shifts at low fields, where $\mu_{\rm B} B\ll E_{\rm hfs}$. Expanding eqn. \ref{eqn:BreitRabi} to second order in small parameter $4mx/(2I+1)+x^2$, and neglecting the field-independent terms, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{\ket{J=1/2 m_J I m_I}}\approx \frac{\Delta E_{\rm hfs}}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{4mx}{2I+1}+x^2\right]-\frac{1}{8}\left[\frac{16m^2 x^2}{(2I+1)^2} +\frac{4mx^3}{2I+1}+x^4\right]\right).
\end{equation}
We recognize the term linear in $mx$,  $\Delta E_{\rm hfs} mx/(2I+1) = (g_J-g_I)\mu_{\rm B} B m/(2I+1)$. In addition, there is a term quadratic in $mx$:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{\rm hfs} \frac{m^2x^2}{(2I+1)^2} = \frac{(g_J-g_I)^2 \mu_{\rm B}^2 B^2 m^2}{\Delta E_{\rm hfs} (2I+1)^2} = \epsilon(B) m^2,
\end{equation}
where in the last term we have defined $\epsilon(B)$, the magnitude of this \lq{quadratic}\rq{} Zeeman energy shift. For the magnetic field strengths used in experiments described in this thesis, the linear term plus quadratic correction are sufficient for describing the energy levels.
%
%. Here $\mu_{\rm B}$ is the Bohr magneton, and $g_J$ and $g_I$ are Lande g-factors. Since $g_J\gg g_I$, at high fields the nuclear spin interaction becomes small compared to the total energy shift, and the levels are grouped according to their $m_J$ quantum number, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:hyperfineSteck}.
%	
%At low fields, however, the states are approximately linearly dependent on the $m_F$ quantum number. The linear shift from the $B=0$ states is known as the linear Zeeman shift. In the intermediate regime, the correction to the linear shift can be expressed in terms of and energy correction to each hyperfine state $\epsilon(B)|m_F|^2$, known as the quadratic Zeeman shift. For the magnetic fields used in experiments described in this thesis, this correction is sufficient for describing the energy levels. 

The form of the approximate Hamiltonian in this regime for any value of $F$ is given by
\begin{equation}
H_0 = H_{\rm KE} + \hbar \omega_z \hat{F}_z + \hbar\epsilon \hat{F}_z^2,
\end{equation}
where $\hbar \omega_z = \mu_{\rm B} g_F B_z/\hbar$, and the kinetic energy Hamiltonian $H_{\rm KE} = \hbar^2 \vec{k}^2/2m \hat{\mathcal{I}}$, and $\hat{\mathcal{I}}$ is the identity matrix.

\section{Near-resonant atom--light interaction}\label{sec:NRatomLight}

In this section, we will assume the atom can be treated as a two-level system: one with a ground state of some energy $\hbar\omega_g$ and excited state with energy $\hbar\omega_e$, with an energy difference $\hbar\omega_0$. The interaction with a light source results from the electric dipole moment of the atom $\vec{d}=-\epsilon_0\vec{r}$ interacting with the electric field of the beam $\vec{\mathcal{E}}(t,\vec{r})$, giving\cite{Fox}
\begin{equation}
H_{\rm L}(t) = -\vec{d}\cdot\vec{\mathcal{E}}(t,\vec{r}).
\label{eqn:atomlight}
\end{equation}

When very weak or no light is being shined on the atom, it still experiences the interaction with vacuum light modes. Through this mechanism, an atom in the excited state may still decay to its ground state (emitting a photon). This is called spontaneous emission, and the time scale on which the decay will happen is determined by the dipole matrix element of the transition, and is known as the  natural transition linewidth of the atomic transition $\Gamma$\cite{Fox}.

\subsection{Rabi oscillations}\label{sec:Rabi}

When strong laser light is present, and on timescales short compared to $1/\Gamma$, spontaneous emission can be ignored\cite{LCT}.  Let us consider the Hamiltonian 
\begin{equation}
H=H_0 + H_{\rm L}(t),
\end{equation}
where $H_0$ is the bare atomic Hamiltonian and $H_{\rm L}$ is the interaction with the laser beam eqn. \ref{eqn:atomlight}. We can write the wavefunction $\Psi$ as a linear combination of the two eigenstates (for a two-level atom) of the bare Hamiltonian $H_0$ as 
\begin{equation}
\Psi = c_g(t)\phi_g ({\bf r})e^{-i\omega_g t} + c_e(t)\phi_e ({\bf r})e^{-i\omega_e t},
\end{equation}
where $c_g(t)$ and $c_e(t)$ are the time-dependent coefficients multiplying the eigenstate wavefuntions $\phi_g$ and $\phi_e$ of the ground and excited state respectively, and ${\bf r}$ is the spatial coordinate. Absorbing any diagonal elements of $H_{\rm L}$ into $H_0$, multiplying both sides of the Schro\"edinger equation from the left by $\psi_j$ and integrating over ${\bf r}$, we can write down the Schro\"edinger equation as two coupled equations:
\begin{equation}
i\hbar\frac{{\rm d}c_g(t)}{{\rm d}t} = c_e(t) H_{\rm L}^{ge}(t)e^{-i\omega_0t}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
i\hbar\frac{{\rm d}c_e(t)}{{\rm d}t} = c_g(t) H_{\rm L}^{eg}(t)e^{i\omega_0t},
\end{equation}
where $\omega_0 = \omega_e - \omega_g$ is the transition frequency, $ H_{\rm L}^{ge}(t)$ is the off-diagonal element of the laser coupling Hamiltonian that couples the excited to the ground state and  $H_{\rm L}^{ge}(t)= H_{\rm L}^{eg*}(t)$. For simplicity, let's consider light propagating along \ez{}, linearly polarized light along \ex{}, $\vec{\mathcal{E}} = (\mathcal{E}_0,0,0){\rm cos}(\omega t)$. The coupling Hamiltonian can then be written as\cite{Fox}
\begin{equation}
 H_{\rm L}^{ge}(t) = -\mu_{ge}\mathcal{E}_0{\rm cos}(\omega t),
\end{equation}
where the electric dipole matrix element $\mu_{ge}=\int \phi_g^* x \phi_e$. This can be written as
\begin{equation}
 H_{\rm L}^{ge}(t) = \hbar \Omega {\rm cos}(kz - \omega_{\rm L} t)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \frac{\mathcal{E}_0|\mu_{ge}|}{\hbar}
\end{equation}
the Rabi frequency, characterizing the coupling strength between the laser field and the atom. Here, $e$ is the charge of the electron. 

To solve this Schro\"edinger equation, we make the traditional transformation to the rotating frame:
\begin{align}
c'_g(t) & = c_g(t)\\
c'_e(t) & = c_e(t) e^{-i\delta t}, 
\end{align}
where $\delta = \omega_0 - \omega_{\rm L}$ is the detuning of laser light from resonance. In this frame, we can write the atom--light Hamiltonian in the $\begin{pmatrix} c'_g \\ c'_e \end{pmatrix}$ basis as:
\begin{equation}
H = \hbar \begin{pmatrix} -\delta/2 & \Omega/2 \\ \Omega/2 & \delta/2 \end{pmatrix}.
\label{eqn:TwoLevelHam}
\end{equation}
In the limit of no coupling, $\Omega = 0$, in the rotating frame the eigenenegies are $E_{\pm} = \pm \hbar \delta/2$. For non-zero coupling, finding the eigenvalues of H gives 
\begin{equation}
E_{\pm} = \pm \hbar \sqrt{\delta^2 + \Omega^2}/2.
\label{eqn:TwoLevelEnergy}
\end{equation}
The eigenenergies are shifted in the presence of the light. 

Assuming the atom starts in the ground state $c_g(t=0)=1$, we can solve the time-dependent Shroedinger equation (TDSE) with the above Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
i\hbar \frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}t} \begin{pmatrix} c'_g \\ c'_e \end{pmatrix} = H \begin{pmatrix} c'_g \\ c'_e \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
we obtain the oscillating excited state amplitude 
\begin{equation}
c'_e(t) = -i \frac{\Omega}{\sqrt{\Omega^2 + \delta^2}}{\rm sin}\left(\frac{\sqrt{\Omega^2 + \delta^2}t}{2}\right),
\label{eq:Rabi}
\end{equation} 
known as Rabi oscillations. The frequency of these oscillations is the generalized Rabi frequency $\Omega'=\sqrt{\Omega^2 + \delta^2}$. The amplitude of the oscillation is at its maximum when the laser is on-resonance, $\delta=0$. As the detuning increases, the contrast in excited and ground populations decreases, while the frequency of the oscillation increases. 

\subsection{Scattering}\label{sec:scattering}
In the regime where spontaneous emission cannot be ignored, Rabi oscillations of each individual atom are intermittently interrupted by decay to the ground state. Averaging over an atomic ensemble, on the time scale of a single Rabi oscillation, the overall excited state population reaches a steady state, and the rate of spontaneous emission becomes constant. Since during spontaneous emission the ejected photon can go into any vacuum mode, this process can be thought of as the scattering of photons by the atoms. This scattering rate is given by\cite{LCT}
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{\rm{sc}}= \frac{\Gamma}{2} \frac{I/I_{\rm{sat}}}{1+4(\delta/\Gamma)^2 +I/I_{\rm{sat}}},
\label{eq:scatrate}
\end{equation}
where $I_{\rm{sat}}$ is the saturation intensity. This is the intensity at which the timescale of spontaneous emission matches the Rabi oscillation rate, reducing the capacity for absorption of extra light.   

\subsection{Adiabatic rapid passage}\label{sec:ARP}

Suppose there is a two-level atom in its ground state that an experimenter wants to transfer into the excited state. To transfer it with perfect fidelity using Rabi oscillations, one would need a perfectly on-resonant beam and very precise timing to shut off the coupling field at the maximum of the excited state population. This is challenging and not very stable to small perturbations in the level splitting between the ground and excited state (caused by small field fluctuations for the case of two Zeeman sublevels). A more robust technique is known as adiabatic rapid passage. 

Suppose the two energy levels of the atom are sensitive to some external parameter. Commonly (as in the case of hyperfine sublevels), they are sensitive to an external magnetic field $B$, and in the small field limit are linear in $B$. Therefore, the detuning that goes into the Hamiltonian in eqn. \ref{eqn:TwoLevelHam} becomes $\hbar\delta = AB - \hbar\omega_{\rm L}$, where $A$ is the coupling constant in the hyperfine (or other) Hamiltonian.   In the limit of zero coupling strength, diagonalizing the Hamiltonian amounts to calculating the eigenenergies in the rotating frame as a function of the control parameter $B$. These are represented in black in Figure \ref{fig:ARPfigure}. Note that the two levels cross each other when their energy difference matches $\hbar\omega_{\rm L}$, on resonance.
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{"Chapter4 Figures/ARPfigure".pdf}
\caption[Adiabatic rapid passage (ARP)]{Adiabatic rapid passage (ARP). Black lines represent energies of the ground and excited state, in the rotating frame, with zero coupling. Blue lines represent these bands with some coupling $\hbar\Omega$ turned on. The dashed lines represent the starting point of an ARP ($B_{\rm start}$), the resonant field value ($B_{\rm res}$) and the end point of an ARP ($B_{\rm stop}$).}
\label{fig:ARPfigure}
\end{figure}

Once the coupling field is turned on (in the case of the hyperfine interaction, and rf-field), the two levels split near the resonance and an avoided crossing appears, as seen in blue in Figure \ref{fig:ARPfigure}. Crucially, away from resonance towards the left, the bottom coupled state overlaps closely with the uncoupled (black state). Far from resonance, the ground state is largely unaffected by the presence of light. On the other hand, far from the resonance on the right, the lower coupled state overlaps almost perfectly with the excited uncoupled state. Adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) takes advantage of this change.

The ARP protocol is as follows. Start at a bias field (or other control parameter) where turning on the coupling field does not significantly perturb the eigenstate ($B_{\rm start}$ in the figure). Turn on the coupling field adiabatically (slow with respect to the time scale associated with the level splitting energy at the selected detuning $\tau = h/(E_{e}-E_{g})$), such that the atom remains entirely in the ground state $\ket{g}$. Then, sweep the control parameter across the resonance, again adiabatically with respect to the coupled level splitting (blue in the figure). The sweep rate can be optimized to be faster away from resonance, where $E_{e}-E_{g}$ is large and slower closer to the avoided crossing. Then, at a final value of the control parameter where the lowest coupled state overlaps almost perfectly with the bare excited state $\ket{e}$, adiabatically turn off the coupling field, leaving the atoms in the excited state. 

The \lq{rapid}\rq{} part of adiabatic rapid passage refers to the procedure having to be fast with respect to the spontaneous emission timescale, since in the coupled basis there is some population in the excited state and spontaneous decay would disrupt the process. This procedure is relatively insensitive to field fluctuations (as long as $B_{\rm res}$ is roughly in the middle of the relatively long sweep, the procedure will succeed). It can also be applied to multi-level situations, for example in the case of the hyperfine states of a single manifold $F$, where the atoms traverse multiple avoided crossings in the same sweep and can be efficiently transferred from one stretch state $m_F=F$ to the other $m_F=-F$, or vice versa. 



\section{Far--off-resonant atom--light interaction}\label{sec:FoRatomLight}

	We can infer the behavior of atoms in a far-detuned laser field by taking the solutions from eqns. \ref{eqn:TwoLevelEnergy} and \ref{eq:Rabi} in the limit $\delta \gg \Omega$. First, looking at the excited state population in eqn. \ref{eq:Rabi}, the amplitude of the excited state population oscillation approaches zero. Therefore, as expected, no absorption of the light actually takes place and the atom remains in the ground state. 
	However, the light still affects the atom by shifting the eigenenergies via eqn. \ref{eqn:TwoLevelEnergy}. Recalling that the bare eigenenergies in the rotating frame are given by $E_{\pm}=\pm \hbar\delta/2$, the energy shift from bare is given by
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{\pm} = \pm\hbar\sqrt{\delta^2+\Omega^2}/2 -\pm \hbar\delta/2.
\end{equation}
Expanding the energy shift in the small parameter $\Omega/\delta$, we obtain the shifted energies $E_{\pm} = \pm \hbar \sqrt{\delta^2 + \Omega^2}/2 \approx \pm (\delta/2 + \Omega^2/4\delta)$. The shift from bare energy levels is thus 
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{\pm} \approx \pm \hbar(\delta/2 + \Omega^2/4\delta)-\pm \hbar\delta/2 = \pm \hbar \Omega^2/4\delta.
\end{equation}
This laser-intensity--dependent energy shift is called the AC Stark shift, and is the basis of most laser created potentials for cold atoms. 
	
For the ground state, and a red detuned laser beam (where the laser frequency is lower than the resonant frequency), this creates energy minima in locations of maximal laser intensity. For the lattice described in this chapter, as well as for the trapping of our atoms in the final stages of cooling, we use high power (up to 10 W) lasers with wavelength $\lambda_{\rm L} = 1064 $ nm. 

\section{Absorption imaging}\label{sec:absorptionImaging}

Absorption imaging takes advantage of the on-resonant interaction described in the previous section. An on or near-resonant laser beam ($\delta/\Gamma\ll 1$) is shined at the atoms, and the absorbed light acts to create a shadow in the shape of the atoms in the laser beam. This beam with the shadow is then imaged on a camera, in our case a CCD, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:absorptionIntor}a (top). This is called the atom image, and the intensity distribution over the camera is denoted by $I_f(x,y)$, where the subscript f stands for final - the intensity after the light has encountered the atoms. To quantify the \lq{shadowed out}\rq{} intensity, after the atoms have left the trap, the same laser intensity is shined directly at the camera, as in Figure \ref{fig:absorptionIntor}a (bottom).   This is called the probe image, and the intensity distribution over the camera is denoted by $I_0(x,y)$, where the subscript 0 indicated initial---the intensity before the light had encountered the atoms.



%Absorption imaging measures the shadow cast by an atomic ensemble in an illuminating probe laser beam with angular frequency $\omega_{\rm{L}}$. 
%\par An absorption image is obtained by shining an on- or near-resonant probe beam ($\tilde{\delta}\ll1$) onto the atomic cloud. Some of the light is scattered by the atoms, and the unscattered light, $\tilde{I}_f(x,y)$, is imaged onto a camera, as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:absorptionIntor}(a) (top). The probe light is reapplied with the atoms absent to calibrate the intensity $\tilde{I}_0(x,y)$ of light unaffected by the atoms (bottom).

A second image taken with no atoms provides a reference. (b)  The probe beam is partially absorbed as it traverses the cloud, and the intensity seen by atoms further along the imaging direction \ez{} is lowered.  (c) An atomic cloud illuminated by a probe light field absorbs photons from the probe and re-emits them in all directions. This process results in a net acceleration of the cloud in the direction of the probe light as well as diffusive spreading in the transverse directions.  }
\label{fig:absorptionIntor}
\end{figure}

To recover the atom number distribution encountered by the light, consider an atomic cloud with 3D density $\rho(x,y,z)$. Since we can only obtain 2D information from the camera, we can only hope to recover a 2D atomic column density $n(x,y)=\int\rho(x,y,z)\mathrm{d}z$. Focusing in on a single pixel of the camera, we can consider a single value of $I_0$ and $I_f$ to recover a local $n$. As the laser light propagates through the atomic cloud, the intensity of the light will diminish due to absorption. This absorption as a function of propagation direction $z$ can be expressed using the scattering rate equation eqn. \ref{eq:scatrate} as the number of photons scattered by the atoms (proportional to the atomic density times the scattering rate) times the photon energy $\hbar\omega_{\rm{L}}$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}z}\frac{I(z)}{I_{\rm{sat}}}=-\hbar\omega_{\rm{L}}\rho(z)\gamma_{sc}(z)=-\rho(z)\sigma_0\frac{I(z)/I_{\rm{sat}}}{1+4\delta^2 /\Gamma^2+I(z)/I_{\rm{sat}}},
\label{eq:dIdz}
\end{equation}
where the resonant scattering cross section is $\sigma_0=3\lambda_0^2/2\pi$, and $\lambda_0$ is the wavelength associated with atomic resonance. 

Integrating both sides of eqn. \ref{eq:dIdz}, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\sigma_0 n = \left(1+4\delta^2/\Gamma^2\right)\mathrm{ln}(I_0/I_f)+ \left(I_0-I_f\right)/I_{\rm{sat}}.
\label{eq2}
\end{equation}
The quantity ${\rm OD}={\rm ln}(I_0/I_f)$ is called the optical depth of the cloud. When the probe intensity $I_0$ is much smaller than the saturation intensity, the second term in eqn. \ref{eq2} becomes negligible. Assuming further that the probe light is on resonance, $\delta=0$, the atomic column density becomes simply $\sigma_0 n={\rm OD}$. Figure \ref{fig:absorptionIntor}b shows a Gaussian atomic density distribution (top) and the resulting probe intensity as a function of position in the cloud (bottom). The intensity drops from its initial to final value gradually as it traverses the cloud.

However, there is an important effect that the above equations do not account for. Namely, as the atoms absorb light from the probe beam, they also get a momentum kick equal to the momentum of a photon during each collision $\hbar k_r=h/\lambda_{\rm L}$ in the direction of propagation. It is true that the absorbed photon will then be re-emitted by the atom, inducing a loss of momentum, but since this happens through the process of spontaneous emission into a random vacuum mode, the average momentum kick acquired this way over many re-emissions will average to zero. On average, each photon absorbed will induce a change in velocity of the atom of $v_r=\hbar k_r/m$, where $m$ is the atomic mass, as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:absorptionIntor}c. As the velocity of the atom changes, due to the Doppler effect, the apparent laser frequency will change as well. Therefore, even if the laser light is exactly on-resonant for a stationary atom, it will become off-resonant for longer imaging times, and eqn. \ref{eq:dIdz} will acquire a time dependence. For most experiments, this effect is small and can be neglected. However, if the imaging time becomes of order a recoil time $t_r$, a time after which the recoil-induced detuning $\delta$ becomes of order $\Gamma$, this effect becomes significant. We explore this effect in Chapter \ref{AbsorptionImagingChapter}.  

\subsection{Time-of-flight and in situ imaging}\label{sec:timeOfFlight}
There are two commonly used protocols for measuring cold atomic clouds, in situ and time-of-flight measurements. Generally, the atomic cloud is trapped (in our case by an optical dipole trap) during the experiment. In situ is Latin for in its original place. As suggested by the name, in situ measurements are taken while the cloud is still in its original trap, or immediately after the trap is turned off before any dynamics have had time to occur. These measurements measure the real spatial distribution of the atoms at the end of the given experiment. There is a difficulty associated with making in situ measurements of BECs, however. Namely, BECs in their original trap tend to be relatively dense, with optical depths often in excess of ${\rm OD}\approx20$, requiring unrealistic probe light intensities to resolve. One way to bypass this difficulty is to selectively image only a small fraction of the condensed atoms, as was done with microwave imaging for our magnetic field stabilization feedforward protocol. Another option is to instead perform a time-of-flight measurement, which reduce the density of the cloud but don't give access to the original density distribution.

In time-of-flight measurements, the trapping potential is abruptly snapped off after the experiment, and the atoms are allowed to free fall and expand for some time $t$. For our experiments, $t$ was on the order of tens of milliseconds. In the regime where time $t$ is long enough that the atoms travel much further than the initial extent of the cloud in the directions transverse to the imaging axis, the final position of the atoms is determined almost exclusively by their in situ momentum, not their in situ position. Therefore, time-of-flight imaging in this regime measures the atomic distribution as a function of momentum, not position.  

\section{One-dimensional optical lattices}\label{sec:1Dlattice}

\subsection{Lattice Hamiltonian}

	Our 1-D optical lattice is created by retro-reflecting the  $\lambda_{\rm L} = 1064 $ nm laser, creating a standing wave of light. Via the AC Stark shift, this creates a periodic potential for the atoms of the form
\begin{equation}
V = - V_0 {\rm sin}^2 (k_{\rm L} x),
\end{equation} 
where $k_{\rm L} = 2\pi/\lambda_{\rm L}$ is the wavenumber associated with the lattice recoil momentum. The time-independent Hamiltonian, for some eigenenergy $E_n$, will be given by
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m}\frac{{\rm d}^2}{{\rm d}x^2}\Psi_n(x)-V_0 {\rm sin}^2 (k_{\rm L} x) \Psi_n(x) = E_n \Psi_n(x).
\end{equation}
Since the potential is spatially periodic, we can invoke Bloch's theorem \cite{Ashcroft}:
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{n,q} =  e^{iqx}u_{n,q}(x), 
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the crystal momentum restricted to $\pm\hbar k_{\rm L}$, and $u_{n,q}(x)$ is the spatially-varying part of the wavefunction obeying the spatial periodicity of the lattice. 
Plugging this in to the Hamiltonian, we obtain
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\left(-q^2 + 2iq\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}x} + \frac{{\rm d}^2}{{\rm d}x^2}\right) u_{n,q}(x) - V_0{\rm sin}^2(k_{\rm L} x) u_{n,q}(x) = E_n u_{n,q}(x).
\end{equation}
Expanding $u_{n,q}(x)$  in Fourier components commensurate with the lattice period of $2 k_{\rm L}$ as $u_{n,q}(x) = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} a_j e^{i 2 k_{\rm L} j x}$, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\sum_j \left(\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(q + 2 k_{\rm L})^2 a_j - V_0 {\rm sin}^2(k_{\rm L} x) a_j\right) e^{i 2 k_{\rm L} j x} = E_n\sum_j a_j  e^{i 2 k_{\rm L} j x}.
\end{equation}
Re-writing ${\rm sin}^2(k_{\rm L} x) = (e^{-2ik_{\rm L} x} + e^{2 i k_{\rm L} x} - 2)/4$, multiplying both sides by $e^{i 2 k_{\rm L} j' x}$ and invoking $\sum c_j e^{i k (j-j')} = \delta_{jj'}$, where $\delta_{j j'}$ is the Kroniker delta and $c_j$ are appropriately normalized coefficients, we get for any value of the index $j$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(q + 2 k_{\rm L} j)^2 a_j - \frac{V_0}{4}(a_{j+1}+a_{j-1}) = E_n a_j.
\end{equation}
This can be expressed in matrix form
\begin{equation}
H_L =
 \begin{pmatrix} \ddots &  & & & & & & \\ 
 & \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(q + 4 k_{\rm L} )^2 & -\frac{V_0}{4} & 0 & 0 & 0 &  \\
 &- \frac{V_0}{4} &\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(q + 2 k_{\rm L} )^2 & -\frac{V_0}{4} & 0 & 0 &  \\
& 0 & -\frac{V_0}{4} & \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}q^2 & -\frac{V_0}{4} & 0 &  \\
 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{V_0}{4} & \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(q - 2 k_{\rm L})^2 & -\frac{V_0}{4} &  \\
 &  & 0 & 0 & -\frac{V_0}{4} & \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(q - 4 k_{\rm L})^2 &  \\
& & & & & & &  \ddots \end{pmatrix} \\,
\label{eqn:LatHam}
\end{equation}
in the basis of momentum orders $\ket{k}=e^{i k x}$ given by:
\begin{equation}
 \begin{pmatrix} \vdots \\
\ket{q+4 k_{\rm L}}\\
\ket{q+2 k_{\rm L}}\\
\ket{q}\\
\ket{q -2 k_{\rm L}}\\
\ket{q - 4 k_{\rm L}}\\
\vdots
\end{pmatrix} \\.
\end{equation}

This matrix can be diagonalized for every value of the crystal momentum $q$, with the resulting band structure shown in Figure \ref{fig:latticeBandStructure}. It is convenient to define the lattice recoil energy $E_{\rm L} = \hbar^2 k_{\rm L}^2/2m$. Then, we can re-write the Hamiltonian with $V_0$ in units of $E_{\rm L}$ and momenta $q$ in units of $k_{\rm L}$ as 
\begin{equation}
H_L/E_{\rm L} =
 \begin{pmatrix} \ddots &  & & & & & & \\ 
 & (q + 4)^2 & -\frac{V_0}{4} & 0 & 0 & 0 &  \\
 & -\frac{V_0}{4} &(q + 2)^2 & -\frac{V_0}{4} & 0 & 0 &  \\
& 0 & -\frac{V_0}{4} & q^2 & -\frac{V_0}{4} & 0 &  \\
 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{V_0}{4} & (q - 2)^2 & -\frac{V_0}{4} &  \\
 &  & 0 & 0 & -\frac{V_0}{4} & (q  - 4)^2 &  \\
& & & & & & &  \ddots \end{pmatrix} \\.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{"Chapter4 Figures/figure1".pdf}
\caption[Lattice band structure in the extended zone scheme]{Lattice band structure in the extended zone scheme. The dashed lines represent the limit of zero lattice depth, with the regular parabolic dispersion relation of a free particle repeating with the reciprocal lattice period. The solid lines are the dispersion relation at $V_0 = 4.0 E_{\rm L}$, showing the opening of gaps at crossings of the zero lattice depth bands. The black lines demarcate the first Brillouin zone. }
\label{fig:latticeBandStructure}
\end{figure}

In any numerical simulation, the number of momentum orders that can be included is finite. We determine the value of the parameter $n = {\rm max}(|j|)$ as the lowest $n$ at which the eigenvalues stop changing to machine precision from $n-1$.

\subsection{Tight-binding approximation}\label{sec:tightBinding}

In the limit of large lattice depths, $V_0 > \approx 5 E_{\rm L}$, the lattice Hamiltonian is well approximated by the tight-binding model with only nearest neighbor hopping. In the tight-binding model, the basis is assumed to be a set of orthogonal functions, called Wannier functions, localized to each lattice site $\ket{j}$.  The approximation lies in assuming only nearest neighbor tunnelings between the sites, forming the nearest-neighbor tight-binding Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H_{\rm tb} = - t \ket{j}\bra{j+1} + {\rm H.c.},
\end{equation}
where $t$ is the tunneling amplitude between nearest neighbor sites and H.c. stands for Hermitian conjugate. We have neglected the diagonal energy term, as it will be equal for every Wannier function $\ket{j}$ and thus represents a constant energy offset. All the information about the lattice depth is therefore reflected in the tunneling amplitude $t$. 

This Hamiltonian can also be expressed in the momentum basis by Fourier transforming the basis functions:
\begin{equation}
\ket{j} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k_j} e^{-i k_j j}\ket{k_j},
\end{equation}
giving the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H_{\rm tb} = - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k_1}\sum_{k_2} t e^{-i j k_1} e^{i k_2 (j+1)} \ket{k_1}\bra{k_2} + {\rm H.c} =-\sum_k 2 t {\rm cos}(k)\ket{k}\bra{k}.
\end{equation}  
From this we can directly read off the band structure of the tight binding Hamiltonian. First, we notice that we only obtain one band---to approximate higher bands with the tight-binding approximation we would need to construct a different set of Wannier functions and a different tunneling strength. Second, we see that the lowest band is simply a cosine--therefore we have solved for the band structure without even defining what the basis Wannier functions are! Third, the amplitude of the cosine function is given by the tunneling strength $t$. This gives us a good clue as to how to determine the appropriate tunneling given a lattice depth $V_0$---simply find a $t$ that matches the amplitude of the lowest band, which becomes cosinusoidal in the deep lattice limit. 

The precise form of the Wannier functions depends on both the depth of the lattice and the band being reproduced. It is not necessary for us to find their full expression, as the band structure can be calculated without them. The definition, however, is
\begin{equation}
\ket{j} = \int_{\rm BZ} e^{i \phi(q) - i q j a}\ket{q} {\rm d} q,
\end{equation}
where the integral is over the Brillouin zone, from $-k_{\rm L}$ to $k_{\rm L}$, $a$ is the lattice spacing $\lambda_{\rm L}/2$, and $\ket{q}$ is the Bloch wavefunction at crystal momentum $q$, and $\phi(q)$ is the phase associated with each Bloch wavefunction. The Bloch wavefunctions individually have arbitrary phase. The phase plays an important role in combining the Bloch wavefunctions into a Wannier function, finding the proper phase relationship to make the wavefunction maximally localized at each site\cite{Marzari2012}. 

\subsection{Pulsing vs adiabatic loading of the lattice}\label{sec:LatticeCalib}

The lattice depth parameter $V_0/4$, for a range of values, can be well calibrated experimentally by pulsing on the lattice. Here, the word pulsing indicates that the lattice is turned on fully non-adiabatically, if not instantaneously, such that the original bare momentum state is projected onto the lattice eigenvector basis, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:pulsingSchematic}a. If the atoms start out stationary in the trap, the bare state in the momentum basis is simply
\begin{equation}
\ket{\Psi_0} = \begin{pmatrix} \vdots \\
0\\
0\\
1\\
0\\
0\\
\vdots
\end{pmatrix} \\,
\end{equation}
as depicted in  Figure \ref{fig:pulsingSchematic}b.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{"Chapter4 Figures/figure2".pdf}
\caption[Lattice pulsing]{Lattice pulsing. (a) Lattice depth as a function of time during a pulsing experiment. The lattice is turned on instantaneously at $t=0$ and held on for a variable amount of time until being turned off instantaneously at a final time $t=t_f$. (b) Atomic population before $t=0$. The dispersion relation is that of a free particle, and all of the atoms start out at $q=0$ in the lowest energy level. Here, the area of the dots is proportional to the fractional population in the energy state. (c) Atomic population after the lattice is turned on for a lattice depth of $V_0 = 8.0 E_{\rm L}$. The energy spectrum now shows the lattice band structure, and some atomic population is projected onto the excited bands. (d) Atomic population after the lattice is snapped off at $t_f = 150$ $\upmu$s. The wavefunction is projected back onto the bare states, with some fraction (blue circle) in the lowest band at $k=0$ and some fraction in the excited band, with equal population being projected onto the $k = 2 k_{\rm L}$ (green) and $k=-2k_{\rm L}$ (red). }
\label{fig:pulsingSchematic}
\end{figure}
Since the lattice eigenvector basis is distinct from the bare one, instantaneously turning on the lattice will necessarily excite the atoms into a superposition of lattice eigenstates, each evolving with a different phase according to the eigenenergy while the lattice is on, as shown in  Figure \ref{fig:pulsingSchematic}c. Then, when the lattice is snapped back off, the wavefunction is projected back into the bare basis, and the varying phase accumulation results in a beating of the different momentum orders, see  Figure \ref{fig:pulsingSchematic}d. This can be calculated simply by using the time evolution operator
\begin{equation}
\ket{\Psi(t)} = e^{-i H_{\rm L} t/\hbar}\ket{\Psi_0}.
\label{eqn:timeEvolveLat}
\end{equation}
By pulsing on the lattice for variable amounts of time $t$, we can obtain fractional populations in the different momentum states. Time-of-flight imaging captures the momentum distribution of the cloud, and the different entries of $\Psi(t)$ in the momentum basis will thus appear as different clouds on the absorption image, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:latticePulsing}a. The fractional population in these clouds corresponds to a measurement of $|a_j|^2$.  Typically for our values of the lattice depth $V_0 < 10 E_{\rm L}$, it is sufficient to simply count three central momentum orders, $k = q, q \pm 2 k_{\rm L}$. Then, we can fit eqn. \ref{eqn:timeEvolveLat} to the data with fitting parameter $V_0$, thus deducing the lattice depth. Some examples of these pulsing experiments are presented in Figure \ref{fig:latticePulsing}b,c.
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{"Chapter4 Figures/LatticePulsing".pdf}
\caption[Lattice pulsing for calibration]{Lattice pulsing for calibration. (a) An example time-of-flight image from a pulsing experiment. The three different clouds are different momentum orders. (b) Fractional populations in the different momentum orders as a function of pulsing time at a low lattice power. Data is indicated by dots and best-fit theory is represented by lines. The lattice depth from fit is $V_0=5.57\pm0.07 E_{\rm L}$. (c)Fractional populations in the different momentum orders as a function of pulsing time at a higher lattice power. Data is indicated by dots and best fit theory is represented by lines. The lattice depth from fit is $V_0=12.69\pm0.07 E_{\rm L}$. }
\label{fig:latticePulsing}
\end{figure}

In contrast to pulsing, adiabatic loading turns the lattice on slowly, such that the atomic wavefunction starting in the bare ground state can continuously adjust to remain in the ground state of the current Hamiltonian, without projecting onto any of the higher bands. This process is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:pulsingSchematic}. The adiabatic timescale depends on the spacing between the ground and next excited band (or if starting in a different eigenstate, the nearest eigenstate). If the energy difference between the ground and first excited state is $\Delta E$, the timescale on which the lattice is turned on must fulfill $t \gg h/\Delta E$.

Since the lowest lattice band is a superposition of bare bands, some atoms are excited to the higher bare momentum states. }

\section{Raman and rf coupling}\label{sec:RamanRf}

In this section, we will introduce Raman and rf coupling between the hyperfine sublevels of the ground state of \Rb{}. While we will focus on the $F=1$ and $F=2$ manifolds of this ground state due to their relevance to the experiments described in Chapters \ref{chap:SynDim} and \ref{chap:BlochOsc}, the discussion can be easily extended to any value of $F$. 

\subsection{Rf coupling Hamiltonian}

	For the $F=1$ manifold, there are three available spin states $m_F = 0,\pm1$. There are many ways of introducing coupling terms between the different hyperfine states. Here, we will explain two methods: rf coupling and Raman coupling. Rf coupling is a radio-frequency oscillating magnetic field, in our case produced by a pair of circular coils in series side by side above the atoms (see \cite{KarinaThesis}). Assuming the rf oscillating field is polarized along the $\mathbf{e}_x$, with the bias field along $\mathbf{e}_z$, the coupling Hamiltonian is given by $H_{\rm rf} = \mu_{\rm B} g_F \hat{\vec{F}}\cdot{}\vec{B} = \mu_{\rm B} g_F \hat{F}_x B_x {\rm cos}(\omega t)$, where $2 \pi\omega$ is the rf frequency. The schematic of this setup is shown in Figure \ref{fig:RamanRfSchematic}.

The eigenstates of the bare Hamiltonian $H_0$ are the constituent $m_F$ states. The eigenstates of the coupled Hamiltonian $H_0 + H_{\rm rf}(t)$ can be expressed as a linear superposition of the bare eigenstates $\Psi(\vec{x},t)=\sum_{m_F}c_{m_F}(t)\phi_{m_F}(\vec{x})e^{-i\omega_{m_F}t}$. The Hamiltonian in this basis can then be written as\cite{LCT}
\begin{equation}
H_{\rm rf} = H_{\rm KE} + \hbar
 \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \Omega {\rm cos}(\omega t)e^{-i(\omega_z-\epsilon)t}  & 0  \\ 
\Omega {\rm cos}(\omega t)e^{-i(\omega_z - \epsilon)t}  & 0 &  \Omega {\rm cos}(\omega t)e^{-i(\omega_z + \epsilon)t} \\
 0 & \Omega {\rm cos}(\omega t)e^{i(\omega_z + \epsilon)t}  & 0  \\
 \end{pmatrix} \\,
\end{equation}
where $\omega_z = (\omega_1-\omega_{-1})/2$, $\epsilon$ is the quadratic Zeeman shift, and $\Omega$ is the Rabi frequency, proportional to $B_x$.
	 We can then transfer into the rotating frame $c'_{m_F} = e^{-i m_F \delta t +i(1-m_F^2)\epsilon t}c_{m_F}$, where $\delta = \omega_z - \omega$. Then we apply the rotating wave approximation, that the fast oscillating terms average to zero over time scales of interest $e^{2i\omega t}\approx 0$, and obtain 

\begin{equation}
H_{\rm rf} = H_{\rm KE} + \hbar
 \begin{pmatrix} \delta & \Omega/2  &  0  \\ 
\Omega/2 & -\epsilon &  \Omega/2 \\
 0 & \Omega/2  & -\delta  \\
 \end{pmatrix} \\,
\label{eqn:rfHam}
\end{equation}
or for any value of $F$
\begin{equation}
H_{\rm rf} = H_{\rm KE} + \hbar\delta F_z + \hbar \epsilon F^2_z + \Omega F_x/2,
\end{equation}
which reduces to the above form for $F=1$ with an overall energy shift of $\hbar\epsilon\mathcal{I}$. 

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{"Chapter2 Figures/RfRamanSetup".png}
\caption[Raman and rf coupling schematic]{Raman and rf coupling schematic. (a) Beam geometry of the Raman beams and rf relative to the external field. The Raman beams have a frequency difference $\Delta\omega$, and are linearly polarized in perpendicular directions. (b) Level structure of both Raman and Rf coupling for hyperfine states of the $F=1$ manifold. The hyperfine splitting separates  the levels by an energy $\hbar\omega_z$. The quadratic Zeeman shift $\epsilon$ lowers the energy of the $m_F=0$ state, and the detuning $\delta$ of either the Raman or the rf fields shifts the energies of the $m_F=\pm1$ states. Raman transitions are two-photon, exciting up to a virtual state and coming back down to an adjacent hyperfine state, with an accompanying momentum transfer. Rf couples adjacent hyperfine states directly. Figure taken from ref. \cite{Karina2012}}
\label{fig:RamanRfSchematic}
\end{figure}

The band structure of this Hamiltonian can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:RfBandStruct}, where we have diaganolized eqn. \ref{eqn:rfHam} for a range of momenta $k_x$ (we have isolated $k_x$ for comparison with Raman coupling, as will be seen in the next section). The parabolas are simply the free particle dispersion relations along one dimension, with three bands arising from the three available spin states. It is convenient to define the magnetization of an eigenstate $m = \sum_{m_F} m_F p_{m_F}$, where $p_{m_F}$ is the fractional population in the $m_F$ state. We have indicated the magnetization of the eigenstate by coloring the eigenenergies, with $m=-1$ in red, $m=0$ in green, and $m=+1$ in blue. In Figure \ref{fig:RfBandStruct}a, both the detuning and the coupling strength are zero. Therefore, there are simply three free particle dispersion curves, each exactly correlated with a particular spin state, the $m_F=\pm1$ are degenerate and the $m_F=0$ state is slightly offset by the quadratic shift $\hbar\epsilon$. In Figure \ref{fig:RfBandStruct}c, the coupling strength is again zero, but the detuning has been turned on, lifting the degeneracy between   the $m_F=\pm1$ states. Figure \ref{fig:RfBandStruct}b,d shows the same conditions as a,c, respectively, but with the coupling strength turned on. In Figure \ref{fig:RfBandStruct}b, where the detuning is zero and the quadratic shift is negligible compared to the coupling strength, all states average to a magnetization of zero---the $m_F=\pm1$ states are symmetrically populated. In Figure \ref{fig:RfBandStruct}d, this symmetry is broken by the presence of a detuning.

\subsection{Raman coupling Hamiltonian}\label{sec:Raman}

	The counter-propagating Raman beams, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:RamanRfSchematic}, couple the same states as the rf. The do so via the vector light shift created by the pair of beams. The electric field due to the right going beam (red in Figure \ref{fig:RamanRfSchematic}a) is $\vec{E} = E_0 {\rm exp}(i k_{\rm R} x - i\omega t) \mathbf{e}_y$, where $E_0$ is the amplitude of the electric field and $\hbar k_{\rm R} = h/\lambda_R=\hbar\omega/c$. The electric field from the left going beam (gray in Figure \ref{fig:RamanRfSchematic}b) is $\vec{E} = E_0 {\rm exp}(-i k_{\rm R} x - i(\omega +\Delta \omega)t) \mathbf{e}_z$. This combines to give an effective field from the vector light shift\cite{SteckTextbook} $B_{\rm eff}\propto \vec{E}\times\vec{E}^* \propto -E^2_0 {\rm cos}(2k_{\rm R} x + \Delta\omega t)\mathbf{e}_x$. Going through the same procedure as for the rf coupling case, including the  transfer into the rotating frame and the rotating wave approximation, we obtain the same Hamiltonian in the basis of bare spin states $\ket{-1},\ket{0},\ket{1}$ but with an extra phase factor:
	 
\begin{equation}
H_{\rm Raman} = H_{\rm KE} + \hbar
 \begin{pmatrix} \delta & \Omega/2 e^{-i 2 k_{\rm R} x}  &  0  \\ 
\Omega/2 e^{i 2 k_{\rm R} x} & -\epsilon &  \Omega/2 e^{-i 2 k_{\rm R} x}\\
 0 & \Omega/2 e^{i 2 k_{\rm R} x} & -\delta  \\
 \end{pmatrix} \\,
\end{equation}
where $\delta = \omega_z - \Delta\omega$.

	This phase difference between the rf and Raman Hamiltonian has an intuitive physical explanation. In order to undergo a Raman transition, an atom first absorbs a photon from one beam, getting a momentum kick equal to the recoil momentum $\hbar k_{\rm R}$. Then, to decay back down to an adjacent spin state, the atom undergoes stimulated emission into the field of the other (counter-propagating) beam, acquiring another recoil momentum kick in the same direction for a total of $2\hbar k_{\rm R} \mathbf{e}_x$. Therefore, the Raman coupling Hamiltonian for $F=1$, after transforming into the rotating frame and performing the rotating wave approximation, can be written in the same way as the rf Hamiltonian in eqn. \ref{eqn:rfHam} with the addition of a momentum kick---in real space, an acquired phase---of $e^{i 2 k_{\rm R} x}$.

	We can again make a basis transformation to get rid of this phase. Let us define  $\ket{-1}' = {\rm exp}(-2ik_{\rm R} x)\ket{-1} = \ket{k_x-2k_{\rm R},-1},\ket{0}' = \ket{0} = \ket{k_x,0},\ket{1}' = {\rm exp}(2ik_{\rm R} x)\ket{1}=\ket{k_x+2k_{\rm R},1}$, where for third definition we went into the momentum basis and labeled the states by a combination of their momentum and spin state. Then, including the kinetic energy term along $\mathbf{e}_x$ explicitly, we obtain the Hamiltonian in the new basis as:
 \begin{equation}
H_{\rm Raman} = H_{\rm KE}^{(y,z)} +
 \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\hbar^2(k_x-2k_{\rm R})^2}{2m}+\hbar\delta & \hbar\Omega/2  &  0  \\ 
\hbar\Omega/2 & \frac{\hbar^2 k_x^2}{2m} - \hbar\epsilon &  \hbar\Omega/2\\
 0 & \hbar\Omega/2 &  \frac{\hbar^2(k_x+2k_{\rm R})^2}{2m} -\hbar\delta  \\
 \end{pmatrix} \\.
\label{eqn:RamanHam}
\end{equation}

It is convenient to define the Raman recoil energy as $E_{\rm R} = \frac{\hbar^2 k_{\rm R}^2}{2m}$. The band structure of this Hamiltonian is shown in Figure \ref{fig:RamanBandStruct}, for several representative parameter values, with the magnetization labeled by the color. Figure \ref{fig:RamanBandStruct}a shows the band structure in the limit of zero coupling and zero detuning, but where we have already gone into the basis $ \ket{k_x-2k_{\rm R},-1}, \ket{k_x,0},\ket{k_x+2k_{\rm R},1}$; therefore, the free particle parabola corresponding to the $m_F=1$ spin states is shifted to center on $k_x=-2k_{\rm R}$ and the $m_F=-1$ parabola is shifted to center on $k_x = 2k_{\rm R}$. As the coupling is turned on to $\hbar\Omega = 1 E_{\rm R}$ in Figure \ref{fig:RamanBandStruct}b, the points where the parabolas cross become \lq{avoided crossings}\rq{}, separating into three bands where magnetization (and the underlying spin distribution) depends on the momentum $k_x$. As the coupling strength is turned up even further to $\hbar\Omega = 5 E_{\rm R}$ in Figure \ref{fig:RamanBandStruct}c, the lowest band goes from having three minima, one corresponding to each original spin state, to only one minimum. This transition happens at $\hbar\Omega = 4 E_{\rm R}$\cite{KarinaThesis}. In Figure \ref{fig:RamanBandStruct}d, we show the band structure again in the limit of zero coupling, but this time with a detuning of $\hbar\delta = 1.0 E_{\rm R}$. Note that the detuning tips the parabolas with respect to each other. Figure \ref{fig:RamanBandStruct}e shows the detuned system with coupling strength turned up to $\hbar\Omega = 1 E_{\rm R}$, still in the three minima regime but with avoided crossings creating three momentum and spin coupled bands. In Figure \ref{fig:RamanBandStruct}f, the detuned system is turned up to a coupling strength of $\hbar\Omega = 5E_{\rm R}$, creating a single minimum, this time offset from $k_x = 0$.

We can write the general $F$ version of the Raman coupled Hamiltonian in the basis $\ket{k_x + m_F 2k_{\rm R},m_F}$, where $-F\leq m_F \leq F$, as:
\begin{equation}
H_{\rm Raman} = H_{\rm KE}^{(y,z)} + \hbar^2 (k_x \mathcal{I} + 2k_{\rm R} F_z)^2/2m +  \hbar\delta F_z + \hbar \epsilon F^2_z + \Omega F_x/2.
\label{eqn:RamanAllF}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Calibration of Raman and rf dressed states}\label{sec:RamanCalib}
To calibrate the rf and Raman coupling strengths, we take a similar approach to the 1-D lattice calibration: start in a pure spin state, for example $m_F = 0$, and turn the coupling on non-adiabatically to induce Rabi oscillations between the coupled states. Then, during time-of-flight, apply a Stern-Gerlach gradient pulse to separate the spin components and observe the fractional populations in different spin states as a function of Rabi oscillation time.  

Figure \ref{fig:RfPulsing}a,b shows example images obtained in time-of-flight when pulsing on an rf coupling field for atoms in the $F=1$ and $F=2$ manifold, respectively. The Stern--Gerlach gradient pulse separates the spin components along the horizontal axis in the images. The fractional population in each state can then be obtained by summing up the optical depth in each cloud and dividing by the total optical depth. Similarly, Figure \ref{fig:RamanPulsing}a shows an example time-of-flight image obtained when pulsing on a Raman coupling field on an $F=1$ cloud initially in the $m_F=0$ spin state. Here, the spin states are separated along the horizontal axis by the same Stern--Gerlach pulse. In addition, the recoil momentum obtained when undergoing a Raman transition separates the different spin states along  the vertical axis---parallel to the Raman beams along ${\bf e}_x$. The direction of the Stern--Gerlach gradient was chosen purposefully to be perpendicular to the Raman direction ${\bf e}_x$ for easy separation of the two effects.

\label{fig:RfPulsing}
\end{figure}

These population oscillations can then be fit for coupling strength $\hbar\Omega$ and detuning $\hbar\delta$. Note that the quadratic Zeeman shift $\hbar\epsilon$ is set by the strength of the bias field $B_0$ and therefore often well known---it is not a fitting parameter. The theoretical predictions are obtained by applying the time evolution operator $U={\rm exp}(-i H_{\rm Raman/rf} t/\hbar)$ to an initial state $\Psi$ in the appropriate basis. Figure \ref{fig:RfPulsing}c shows an example time series of rf pulsing in the $F=1$ manifold, starting in the $m_F=0$ state. The lines of best fit are overlayed on experimental data, extracting fit parameters $\hbar\Omega=(0.863\pm0.004) E_{\rm R}$ and $\hbar\delta=(-0.198\pm0.007) E_{\rm R}$. Figure \ref{fig:RfPulsing}d shows an example time series of rf pulsing in the $F=2$ manifold, starting in the $m_F=-2$ state. Here, the extracted fit parameters were $\hbar\Omega=(1.000\pm0.002) E_{\rm R}$ and $\hbar\delta = (-0.061\pm0.001) E_{\rm R}$.

Figure \ref{fig:RamanPulsing}b shows an example time series of Raman pulsing in the $F=1$ manifold, starting in the $m_F=0$ state, with fitted parameters  $\hbar\Omega=(1.47\pm0.01) E_{\rm R}$ and $\hbar\delta = (0.004\pm0.024) E_{\rm R}$. Note that although the coupling strength is almost double the rf coupling strength in Figure \ref{fig:RfPulsing}c, the contrast (peak to peak oscillation of the fractional population in, say, the $m_F=0$ state) is much lower in the Raman data than in the rf. This is a direct consequence of the recoil momentum transfer, and can be understood by looking at the band structure. For rf, the coupled bands at initial momentum $k_x=0$ are separated by the coupling strength, see Figure \ref{fig:rfBandStruct}b. For Raman, even at zero coupling strength, due to the shifting of the parabolas by $2k_{\rm R}$, and $k_x=0$ the higher bands are $\hbar^2(2k_{\rm R})^2/2m=4E_{\rm R}$ separated from the lower bands. Therefore, the energy difference is larger and the fraction in the excited band will be lower, leading to lower contrast.

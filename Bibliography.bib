 sample of Rb-85 atoms. Long lived condensates of up to 10(4) atoms have
 been produced by using a magnetic-field-induced Feshbach resonance to
 reverse the sign of the scattering length. This system provides new
 opportunities for the study of condensate physics. The variation of the
 scattering length near the resonance has been used to magnetically tune
 the condensate self-interaction energy over a wide range, extending from
 strong repulsive to large attractive interactions. When the interactions
 were switched from repulsive to attractive, the condensate shrank to
 below our resolution limit; and after similar to 5 ms emitted a burst of
 high-energy atoms.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Cold atom experiments often use images of the atom clouds as their
 exclusive source of experimental information. The most commonly used
 technique is absorption imaging, which provides accurate information
 about the shapes of the atom clouds, but requires care when seeking the
 absolute atom number for small atom samples. In this paper, we present
 an independent, absolute calibration of the atom numbers. We directly
 compare the atom number detected using dark-ground imaging to the one
 observed by fluorescence imaging of the same atoms in a magneto-optical
 trap. We normalise the signal using single-atom resolved fluorescence
 imaging. In order to be able to image the absorption of the very low
 atom numbers involved, we use diffractive dark-ground imaging as a
 novel, ultra-sensitive method of in situ imaging for untrapped atom
 clouds down to only 100 atoms. We demonstrate that the Doppler shift due
 to the acceleration of the atoms by the probe beam has to be taken into
 account when measuring the atom-number.}},

Fermionic lithium-6 atoms in an optical trap are evaporatively cooled to degeneracy using a magnetic field to induce strong, resonant interactions. Upon abruptly releasing the cloud from the trap, the gas is observed to expand rapidly in the transverse direction while remaining nearly stationary in the axial direction. We interpret the expansion dynamics in terms of collisionless superfluid and collisional hydrodynamics. For the data taken at the longest evaporation times, we find that collisional hydrodynamics does not provide a satisfactory explanation, whereas superfluidity is plausible.},

 this resonance is precisely determined from low-density measurements of
 molecule dissociation. In order to search for condensation on either
 side of the resonance, we introduce a technique that pairwise projects
 fermionic atoms onto molecules; this enables us to measure the momentum
 distribution of fermionic atom pairs. The transition to condensation of
 fermionic atom pairs is mapped out as a function of the initial atom gas
 temperature T compared to the Fermi temperature T-F for magnetic-field
 detunings on both the BCS and BEC sides of the resonance.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The low-energy Feshbach resonances recently observed in the
 inter-particle interactions of trapped ultra-cold atoms involve an
 intermediate quasi-bound molecule with a spin arrangement that differs
 from the trapped atom spins. Variations of the strength of an external
 magnetic field then alter the difference of the initial and intermediate
 state energies (i.e. the `detuning'). The effective scattering length
 that describes the low-energy binary collisions, similarly varies with
 the near-resonant magnetic field. Since the properties of the dilute
 atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) are extremely sensitive to the
 value of the scattering length, a `tunable' scattering length suggests
 highly interesting many-body studies. In this paper, we review the
 theory of the binary collision Feshbach resonances, and we discuss their
 effects on the many-body physics of the condensate. We point out that
 the Feshbach resonance physics in a condensate can be considerably
 richer than that of an altered scattering length: the Feshbach resonant
 atom-molecule coupling can create a second condensate component of
 molecules that coexists with the atomic condensate. Far off-resonance, a
 stationary condensate does behave as a single condensate with effective
 binary collision scattering length. However, even in the off-resonant
 limit, the dynamical response of the condensate mixture to a sudden
 change in the external magnetic field carries the signature of the
 molecular condensate's presence: experimentally observable oscillations
 of the number of atoms and molecules. We also discuss the stationary
 states of the near-resonant condensate system. We point out that the
 physics of a condensate that is adiabatically tuned through resonance
 depends on its history, i.e. whether the condensate starts out above or
 below resonance. Furthermore, we show that the density dependence of the
 many-body ground-state energy suggests the possibility of creating a
 dilute condensate system with the liquid-like property of a
 self-determined density. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

  Abstract                 = {Interactions between particles can be strongly altered by their environment. We demonstrate a technique for modifying interactions between ultracold atoms by dressing the bare atomic states with light, creating an effective interaction of vastly increased range that scatters states of finite relative angular momentum at collision energies where only s-wave scattering would normally be expected. We collided two optically dressed neutral atomic Bose-Einstein condensates with equal, and opposite, momenta and observed that the usual s-wave distribution of scattered atoms was altered by the appearance of d- and g-wave contributions. This technique is expected to enable quantum simulation of exotic systems, including those predicted to support Majorana fermions.},
